*Busy flag (BF)*
When busy flag is set, controller is in internal operation mode.
When RS:RW are 01, busy flag is output to DB7. The next instruction
must be written after busy flag is cleared.

*Address Counter (AC)*
Assigns addresses to DDRAM and CGRAM.

# Display Data RAM (DDRAM)
Used to store display data represented in 8-bit character codes.
Extended capacity is 80 chars.

0x00:0x0F	Top row
0x40:0x4F	Bottom row

# Character Generator ROM (CGROM)
Generates 5x8 dot or 5x10 dot character patterns.

# Character Generator RAM (CGRAM)
Used to rewrite character.
